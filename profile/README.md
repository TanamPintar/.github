Tanam Pintar is an android application that helps you to detect the soil around you easily, so you can find out the type of soil and recommend the right plants.
Our project addresses the critical challenge of optimizing soil classification for planting purposes, aiming to provide tailored recommendations for appropriate plants. The problem stems from the lack of accessible tools for farmers, gardeners, and individuals interested in starting gardening to accurately assess their soil's composition and make informed decisions about cultivation. Our research questions revolve around developing a user-friendly classification system that integrates soil data analysis with plant recommendations. This initiative is fueled by the pressing need to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability while minimizing resource wastage and environmental impact. By creating a solution that simplifies soil analysis and offers actionable insights, we aspire to empower individuals involved in cultivation to maximize their yield potential and contribute to a more efficient and eco-conscious agricultural ecosystem.
